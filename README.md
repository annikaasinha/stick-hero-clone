"To run the project, please run HelloApllication.java file inside the main -> java directory"


Object Oriented Programming concepts have been used to organise and simplify code structure

- Interfaces (GameController)
- Abstract Classes (ObjectController)
- Encapsulation (in all classes to integrate variables and methods into a single unit)


Singleton Design Pattern used in PillarController to ensure a single instance at any given point in time.


JUnitTests have been written to assert some essential information like Pillar Widths, Player and Stick's start points and more.


Attributes have been kept private in all classes (unless necessary otherwise)
Methods have been kept public in all classes (unless necessary otherwise)


Some mechanics of the game include :-

1)The length of the stick increases on pressing the mouse on the hero and the length stops increasing on releasing the mouse

2)The hero flips when you press anywhere on the background

3)Cherries are generated on a random basis when sufficient space is available between the 2 pillars in the screen. The distance between two pillars is checked and then cherry is generated.

4)Music is played using an audio file imported from the internet whose link has been provided above.

5)The high Score is generated using a high Score Manager class which stores the highScores in a text file and displays high score accordingly.

6)Points are counted on the basis of number of pillars that the stickHero crosses.

7)There is a pause button, which allows the player to pause the game and store the current score and also resume the game using the resume button.


The project has been made using JavaFx and Scenebuilder.
