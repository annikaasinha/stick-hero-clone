### Project Members

###  How to Run the Project

To launch the game, execute the `HelloApplication.java` file located in the `src/main/java` directory.



###  Object-Oriented Concepts Used

This project applies key OOP principles to ensure maintainability and modularity:

* **Interfaces:**
  Used for generalization, e.g., `GameController`.

* **Abstract Classes:**
  Used for shared logic, e.g., `ObjectController`.

* **Encapsulation:**
  All classes encapsulate data and behavior, exposing only necessary functionality.

* **Singleton Pattern:**
  Implemented in `PillarController` to ensure a single instance manages pillar states.



###  Testing

* **JUnit Tests** are written to validate:

  * Pillar widths
  * Initial player and stick positions
  * Other core game parameters



###  Code Structure

* All attributes are marked `private` unless otherwise necessary.
* Only essential methods are declared `public`.


###  Game Mechanics

1. **Stick Growth:**
   Stick extends while the mouse is pressed on the hero and stops upon release.

2. **Hero Flip:**
   The hero flips when you click on the background.

3. **Cherry Generation:**
   Cherries spawn randomly if there's enough space between pillars.

4. **Audio Integration:**
   Background music is embedded and plays during gameplay.

5. **High Score Tracking:**
   A `HighScoreManager` class handles reading and writing scores to a file.

6. **Scoring Logic:**
   Score increases based on the number of pillars the hero successfully crosses.

7. **Pause/Resume Feature:**
   A pause button saves the current game state and allows you to resume.



###  Technologies Used

* **Java**
* **JavaFX**
* **SceneBuilder**
* **JUnit**
